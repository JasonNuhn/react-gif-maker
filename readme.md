### React-Gif-Maker
Fetch a video via these sites <https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.md> or a .mp4 file to load into the video player.

Set an inpoint (where you want the finished gif to start) and an outpoint (where you want it to end).

Click Create Animated GIF, give it some time. Before you know it, you'll have a nicely compressed .gif file ready to share with the world.

#### Still very untested
Please be aware, we haven't done a great deal of testing. If you notice something strange, let us know by filing an issue.

#### Bugs
Some Safari browsers running on El Capitan will not display preview thumbnails properly. The only work around right now is to simply resize your browser.
